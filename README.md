# LA-LocalGeo-CrossWalk
A single file that links up all the local geographies in LA County. See [here for an example in NYC from @vr00n](https://github.com/vr00n/NYC-LocalGeo-CrossWalk)

A preliminary timeline for the project is shown below:

## Why do we need this?

This dataset could help answer questions like this more easily while also reducing the overall friction to integrate data from disparate domains.

    How many and which Census Tracts are located in LAUSD District X?
    AND 
    Which Fire District is serviced by this School District?
    AND 
    Which City Council District is this School District in?
    AND 
    Which Congressional District is it in?
    AND
    How many Health Centers are in this area?

## What is this?

This file links up the following geographies in a single tabulated file (CURRENTLY ASPIRATIONAL):

- City boundaries
- Census Blocks 2010
- Census Tracts 2010
- City Council Districts
- Community Districts
- County Supervisorial Seats
- Fire Battalions (MAY NOT BE PERTINENT IN LA)
- Fire Companies (MAY NOT BE PERTINENT IN LA)
- Fire Divisions (MAY NOT BE PERTINENT IN LA)
- Health Area
- Health Center
- Municipal Court Districts
- Neighborhood Tabulation Areas
- Police Precincts
- PUMA
- Retail Water Districts
- School Districts
- State Assembly Districts
- State Senate Districts
- U.S. Congressional Districts
- Wholesale water districts (member agencies of Metropolitan Water District)

## How will we get this done?

- The SCAG GIS Services should provide the most comprehensive inventory of boundaries: http://gisdata.scag.ca.gov/Pages/GIS-Library.aspx

- I'd also recommend looking into the various city-specific and LA county open data portals inventoried at the LACounts.org website. 

- See the LA County LAFCO SB 272 inventory for some umwelt on how these sorts of boundaries are currently tracked: http://www.lalafco.org/Forms/Public%20Records/Enterprise%20System%20Catalog.pdf
