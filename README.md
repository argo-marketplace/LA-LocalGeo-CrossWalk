# LA-LocalGeo-CrossWalk
A single file that links up all the local geographies in LA County. See [here for an example in NYC from @vr00n](https://github.com/vr00n/NYC-LocalGeo-CrossWalk)

A preliminary timeline for the project is shown below:

| Original Timeline | Deliverable |

## Why do we need this?

This dataset could help answer questions like this more easily while also reducing the overall friction to integrate data from disparate domains.

    How many and which Census Tracts are located in LAUSD District X?
    AND 
    Which Fire District is serviced by this School District?
    AND 
    Which City Council District is this School District in?
    AND 
    Which Congressional District is it in?
    AND
    How many Health Centers are in this area?

## What is this?

This file links up the following geographies in a single tabulated file (CURRENTLY ASPIRATIONAL):

City boundaries
Census Blocks 2010
Census Tracts 2010
City Council Districts
Community Districts
County Supervisorial Seats
Fire Battalions (MAY NOT BE PERTINENT IN LA)
Fire Companies (MAY NOT BE PERTINENT IN LA)
Fire Divisions (MAY NOT BE PERTINENT IN LA)
Health Area
Health Center
Municipal Court Districts
Neighborhood Tabulation Areas
Police Precincts
PUMA
Retail Water Districts
School Districts
State Assembly Districts
State Senate Districts
U.S. Congressional Districts
Wholesale water districts (member agencies of Metropolitan Water District)

## How was this done?

First need to do the work! See below for some hopefully useful resources in tackling that:

- The SCAG GIS Services should provide the most comprehensive inventory of boundaries: http://gisdata.scag.ca.gov/Pages/GIS-Library.aspx

- I'd also recommend looking into the various city-specific and LA county open data portals inventoried at the LACounts.org website. 

- See the LA County LAFCO SB 272 inventory for some umwelt on how these sorts of boundaries are currently tracked: http://www.lalafco.org/Forms/Public%20Records/Enterprise%20System%20Catalog.pdf
