- [Census Block](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2016/01/26/census_blocks/)

File 'Registrar Recorder Precincts' covered information of:

- [Health Districts (HD) – 2012](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2012/03/01/health-districts-hd-2012/)

We excluded datasets that have been covered in files 'Registrar Recorder Precincts' and 'Census Blocks'.

Some geometries are subset of LA County, but geopandas 'sjoin', 'overlay(how='union')', and 'spatial_overlays(how='union')' are not working well for now. So datasets that
are subset of LA County haven't been included in this version.
Those datasets are:
- [Split 2010 Block Group/City – Community Statistical Area (formerly BASA)](https://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2016/01/18/split-2010-block-groupcity-basa/)
- [Town Council / Community Group](https://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2014/12/29/town-council-areas/)
- [Los Angeles County Fire Department Division Boundaries](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2016/04/28/los-angeles-county-fire-department-division-boundaties/)
- [Los Angeles County Fire Department Battalion Boundaries](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2016/04/28/los-angeles-county-fire-department-battalion-boundaries/)
- [LA City Council Districts (2012)](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2012/08/07/la-city-council-districts-2012/)
- [Comunity Plan Areas](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2015/09/21/la-city-communities-and-planning-areas/)
- [CDC Project Areas](https://egis3.lacounty.gov/dataportal/2015/06/09/cdc-project-areas/)
